### Laboratory Experiment No. 5
 
### Objective  
To implement 8051 Timer functionality for different delay periods & To generate a square wave of a particular frequency.
 
### Tools used  
- Software: 
  - MCU 8051 IDE 

### Experiment Outcome
-  To learn about 8051 Timer & various Timer modes
-  To generate a basic delay using Timer0/1
-  To generate a square wave of 50/100/200 Hz
-  To generate a long delay (>= 1 sec)

### Instructions

1. Read about Timer functionalities of 8051 from 8051-Kenneth Ayala book
2. Use the Atmel 8051 Instruction sheet document to learn about the arithmetic instructions

### Final list of Deliverables for Expt 5
